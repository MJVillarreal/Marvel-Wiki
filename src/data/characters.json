        "story": "Vision’s story begins with his creation in Avengers: Age of Ultron. He is born from a combination of advanced technology and the Mind Stone, which is embedded in his forehead. Vision’s origins are complex, involving a synthesis of Tony Stark’s artificial intelligence, J.A.R.V.I.S., and the vibranium body constructed by Ultron. Despite his origins being tied to a villain’s plan, Vision emerges as a unique and sentient being with his own identity, values, and capabilities.\n\nAs a new member of the Avengers, Vision’s journey starts with him grappling with his identity and purpose. His initial role is marked by his powerful abilities, including his capacity to phase through objects and manipulate his density, making him a formidable ally in the fight against Ultron. Vision's presence in Age of Ultron reflects his transition from a creation of technology to an autonomous hero, demonstrating both his strength and his inherent goodness.\n\nIn Captain America: Civil War, Vision is depicted as an ally of Iron Man and a supporter of the Sokovia Accords, which seek to regulate superpowered individuals. His adherence to the Accords puts him at odds with some of his fellow Avengers, particularly Captain America. Vision’s role in this film highlights his internal struggle between following his programming and aligning with his own moral compass.\n\nAvengers: Infinity War sees Vision at the center of a crucial conflict involving Thanos, who seeks to obtain the Mind Stone embedded in his forehead. Vision and Wanda Maximoff, who is deeply connected to him, face an intense struggle to protect the stone and thwart Thanos’s plans. The film showcases Vision’s vulnerability and the intense emotional stakes as Thanos ultimately succeeds in obtaining the Mind Stone. Vision is destroyed by Wanda’s attempt to destroy the stone, and then later resurrected by Thanos, leading to his demise as Thanos uses the stone to complete the Snap.",
